# BulaCode
Bula! This is my coding hub from the University of the South Pacific, where I stash software engineering projects, scripts, and hacks from my Bachelor’s journey. Inspired by the Pacific spirit, it’s a mix of practical solutions and tropical trial-and-error—straight from Fiji’s shores to the digital world.
