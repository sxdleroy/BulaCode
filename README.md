# BulaCode  
**Bula vinaka!** Welcome to **BulaCode**—my slice of the digital Pacific where I dock the code crafted during my Bachelor’s in Software Engineering at the University of the South Pacific. This repo is my island of innovation, packed with projects, scripts, and solutions born from tropical nights and USP’s tech tides. It’s not just code—it’s a "hello" from Fiji to the world of software!

## About BulaCode  
**BulaCode** is where I log my voyage as a budding software engineer. From the sandy shores of Suva to the virtual stacks of GitHub, this repo holds my coursework treasures—think algorithms swaying like palm trees, data structures as sturdy as coral reefs, and bugs squashed under the South Pacific sun. It’s my proof that paradise and programming can coexist.

## What’s in the Lagoon?  
- **Projects & Assignments**: Software engineering gems from USP’s curriculum.  
- **Languages**: A cocktail of Python, Java, C++, or whatever the tide brings in.  
- **Vibes**: Organized by course, semester, or the chaos of inspiration—dive in and explore!  

### Highlights  
- **Island Algorithms**: Sorting and searching, Pacific-style.  
- **Code Canoes**: Small scripts that paddle through big problems.  
- **Engi-Nerd Logs**: Experiments that worked (and some that sank).  

## How to Navigate  
Clone this repo and paddle through:  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/BulaCode.git  
cd BulaCode  
```  
Some projects might need a specific setup—check comments or mini-READMEs if I left a map. Otherwise, bring Python 3.x, a compiler, and a splash of curiosity.

## Why This Exists  
- To chart my growth from code rookie to software skipper.  
- To share the USP coding spirit with fellow explorers (or future me when I forget my own logic).  
- To make my island ancestors proud—one commit at a time.  

## Contributions  
This is my personal reef, so no pull requests for now. Got ideas or want to talk shop? Drop a line via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/[YourUsername]/BulaCode/issues) or catch me on the digital breeze.

## Bula Bonus  
Those green squares on my graph? Powered by kava-fueled focus and the rhythm of the lali drum. Watch them bloom as I sail through semesters!

## License  
Free to browse and learn from, but if you’re submitting this to USP, I’ve already claimed the mataqali bragging rights. No formal license—just Pacific honor for now.
